# preRNG
pre-RNG is an in-lab cryptographic pre-registration scheme, that guarantees registration time-locking without compromising scientific autonomy and confidentiality. This repository includes Python, Matlab and R implementations of preRNG. All three implementations get as input the path to a compressed protocol folder and an optional argument specifying the subject number, and return the protocol sum after initiating the PRNG.
