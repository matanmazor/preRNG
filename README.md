# preRNG
pre-RNG is an in-lab cryptographic pre-registration scheme, that guarantees registration time-locking without compromising scientific autonomy and confidentiality. This repository includes Python, Matlab and R implementations of preRNG. All three implementations get as input the path to a compressed protocol folder and an optional argument specifying the subject number, and return the protocol sum after initiating the PRNG.

A pre-print publication describing the scheme is available on https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/06/213439
